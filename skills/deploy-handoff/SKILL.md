name: deploy-handoff
description: >-
  Gives the last step of a deploy, billing, or sign-in task to the user. Use it
  before you drive the browser. Drive the Brave profile where the user is signed
  in, never a fresh profile. Then a dialog tells the user what to do: the final
  publish, pay, or submit click, a sign-in, an OAuth consent, or the creation of
  an API key. Examples: Stripe live mode, Google Play Console releases, F-Droid
  merge requests, hosting consoles. Also use it for a question that a program
  asks in a terminal, for example an install question or the sign-in of a
  command line program. Also use it for the submit of a change: git push, a
  release, or a production deploy that the user did not ask you to run. Also use
  it to open every GitHub pull request, instead of gh pr create or another pull
  request tool.

# deploy-handoff

`handoff.py` is in the base directory of this skill. In the commands below, replace `SKILL_DIR` with that directory. Run the script with Python 3.11 or later: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on other systems.

Run the commands in a POSIX shell. On Windows, use Git Bash. Windows PowerShell 5.1 removes the double quotation marks inside the arguments.

The script shows a small dialog on top of the browser. The dialog tells the user what to do. The user does the last step and clicks **Done** or **Not done**. The script never clicks for the user. If Python has no Tk, for example on a Wayland desktop without X11, the script shows the steps in a `bemenu` list instead.

## 0. Select the automation mode

The user is signed in to the deploy consoles in one Brave profile. The `brave_profile` key in the user config file names it. Always use that profile. Never use a fresh browser profile unless the user asks for it in this session. A fresh profile has no sign-in.

Before you do the work, select one of these modes:

| Mode | Use it when |
|---|---|
| PowerShell command | A CLI or API does the step, for example `vercel deploy`, `gh release create`, or `stripe`. Run it with the PowerShell tool. If the command is a submit and the user did not give the word, see "Hand off the submit of a command". |
| Brave with the Claude extension | The `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools are available, and the extension runs in the Brave profile of the user. This is the default browser mode. |
| Terminal prompt | The step is a question that a program asks in a terminal: an install question, a sign-in of a command line program, or a confirmation. See "Hand off a step in a terminal". |
| Windows-MCP | The step is in a desktop app or an operating system dialog, not in a web page. |
| Dialog with instructions only | No automation tool is available, or the user wants to do all the steps. Run `handoff.py open` without `--no-open`. The script opens the page in the Brave profile of the user. |
| Fresh Brave profile with Playwright | Only if the user asks for it. The `browser-driver` agent uses `handoff.py browser --fresh` and the Playwright MCP. |
| Fresh browser (built-in browser) | Only if the user asks for it. Use the `mcp__Claude_Browser__*` tools. |

Guess the mode with these rules, in this order:

1. If the user named a mode in this session, use it.
2. If a command can do the step, use "PowerShell command".
3. If the step is a question that a program asks in a terminal, use "Terminal prompt".
4. If the step is not in a web page, use "Windows-MCP".
5. If the `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools are available, use "Brave with the Claude extension".
6. Otherwise, use "Dialog with instructions only".

If a mode fails, use "Dialog with instructions only". Do not go to a fresh browser unless the user asks for it. Tell the user in one sentence which mode you use.

## 1. Drive the browser to the last step

The user must do only the last step. Do all the other work first.

1. Do the work that needs no browser. For example, push the branch or upload the build with an API.
2. Drive the browser yourself with the mode that section 0 selects. Use the Brave profile of the user. Open the page of the last step. Fill in the fields that do not contain secrets. Stop before the last step.
3. Run `handoff.py open --no-open` with the URL of the current page.

If you have no browser tools, give `handoff.py` the URL of the deepest page that you know. Do not give the home page of the console.

Never do these steps yourself. Give them to the user:

- Type a password, a one-time code, an API key, a token, or a card number.
- Sign in, or create an account.
- Solve a CAPTCHA or another check that you are a human.
- Accept terms, a consent screen, or an OAuth consent.
- Create or show a secret, for example an API key or a webhook secret.
- Change a security setting, a payment method, or the access of a person.
- Click the final button that publishes, deploys, pays, buys, submits, merges, or deletes.
- Run a submit that the user did not ask you to run: `git push`, a release, a production deploy.

### The browser-driver agent

Use the agent only if the user asks for it. The agent does the browser steps in its own browser: a fresh Brave or Chrome profile in its own window. This profile has no sign-in of the user. Playwright MCP controls this browser through a local port, so the user can keep working. On Windows, the agent can also use Windows-MCP for a window of the operating system. The agent never does a human step.

The agent cannot use the Brave profile of the user. Chromium 136 and later ignores the remote debugging port for the default profile folder.

The user signs in to each console one time in this browser. The browser keeps the sign-in. When the agent finds a sign-in page, it gives the sign-in to the user as a human step.

1. Start the browser. The command prints one JSON object with the status `started` or `running`. Without `--fresh`, the command refuses to start:

   ```bash
   python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py browser --fresh
   ```

2. Tell the user in one sentence that the agent works in its own browser window. Ask the user not to close that window.
3. In Claude Code, start the agent with the Agent tool and `subagent_type: "deploy-handoff:browser-driver"`. Give it this information:
   - The title and the start URL.
   - All the steps in order, with the human step last.
   - The text for each field, and the absolute path of each file to upload. The files must be in the project folder.

The agent ends its answer with one JSON object:

| `status` | Meaning | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| `done` | The agent did all the steps. The task had no human step. | Check the result. Do not show the dialog. |
| `ready` | The page of a human step is open. | Run `handoff.py open --no-open` with its `url`, `title`, and `steps`. |
| `not_done` | The agent cannot continue. `note` gives the error. | Read the next paragraph. |

If the answer has no JSON object, treat it as `not_done`.

After `not_done`, read the note. If you can fix the cause, for example a wrong URL, fix it and start the agent again one time. If you cannot fix it, run `handoff.py open` without `--no-open`, with all the steps for the user. Tell the user the error in one sentence.

The `note` of a `ready` answer can name steps that remain after the human step. If the user answers `done` in the dialog, start the agent again for those steps.

## 2. Write the steps in Simplified Technical English

The user reads the title and the steps in the dialog. Write them in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English:

- Start each step with a verb in the imperative, for example Click, Open, Select, or Make sure.
- Give one action in each step. Use 20 words or fewer. Do not use semicolons.
- Write the exact name of each button or menu item in quotation marks.
- Put a condition before its action: 'If the page asks for a code, type the code from your phone.'
- Make the title the result of the steps, for example 'Send version 1.4.0 for review'.

The script refuses a title or a step that has more than 20 words or a semicolon.

- Good: `Click "Send changes for review".`
- Bad: `Review everything, then submit it and tell me when it is done; check the release notes too.`

## 3. Run the handoff

```bash
python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py open --no-open \
  --url "https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/123/app/456/publishing" \
  --title "Send version 1.4.0 for review" \
  --step 'Make sure that the page shows version 1.4.0.' \
  --step 'Click "Send changes for review".'
```

- Do not give `--no-open` if you did not open the page. Then the script opens the URL in a new tab of the Brave profile that `brave_profile` names in the user config file. If the file names no profile, the script uses the default browser.
- The URL must use `https` and printable ASCII. Percent-encode all other characters.
- The host must be an allowed host. If the script refuses the host, ask the user to add it. Do not add it yourself.

Useful start pages:

| Service | Page |
|---|---|
| Stripe API keys | `https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys` (test mode: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys`) |
| Google Play Console | `https://play.google.com/console` |
| F-Droid merge requests | `https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests` |
| GitHub device sign-in | `https://github.com/login/device` |

## Hand off a step in a terminal

Some human steps are not on a web page. A program asks a question in a terminal and waits. Examples: an install question such as `Install ...? [Y/n]`, the sign-in of a command line program, a confirmation before a change that cannot be undone. Bring the user to the question. The user gives the answer.

1. Do the work that comes before the question with commands.
2. Start the program in a terminal that the user can see and type in. In the Claude Code desktop app, use the tool that types a command into a tab of the Terminal panel. Give the tab a title that names the step. If you have no such tool, give the user the one command that starts the program.
3. Read the terminal. Make sure that the program shows the question and waits.
4. Do not type the answer. Do not give the answer in another way, for example with `yes |` or with a `--yes` option.
5. Show the dialog. Run the command in the background:

   ```bash
   python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py terminal \
     --title "Install Herdr on the build server" \
     --where 'Terminal tab "herdr: add build server"' \
     --step 'Press "Y".'
   ```

6. Wait for the result of the step, not only for the dialog. For example, run the command that lists the new item until the item is there. Then continue. A `done` answer with no result is not done.

The `terminal` command opens no page, so it needs no URL and no allowed host. `--where` names the terminal in 20 words or fewer. The title and the steps follow section 2.

More than one question can wait at the same time. Start each program in its own tab, and name each tab in its dialog.

If the program asks for a password, a code, or a key, the user types it in the terminal. Never ask for the value in the chat.

Do not give the user a list of commands to copy and run. A command that needs no answer from a person is your work: run it. Give the user only the question.

## Hand off the submit of a command

A submit is a command that sends work out of this computer, or that changes a live system. Examples: `git push`, the push of a tag, `gh release create`, a package publish, a production deploy, the restart of a live service.

The submit is the step of the user. Run it yourself only when the user gave the word for this change in this session: the word DEPLOY, or a direct instruction such as "push it". An approval for one change does not apply to the next change.

Without the word, bring the user right up to the submit:

1. Do all the work that comes before the submit. Verify the change. Stage the files, write the commit message, and make the commit. Make the tag and the build if the submit needs them.
2. Start the submit in a terminal that the user can see and type in. Use the tool that types a command into a tab of the Terminal panel. Give the tab a title that names the step:

   ```bash
   python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py submit --title "Push 2 commits to origin main" -- git push origin main
   ```

   The script shows the title and the command. Then it waits. The command runs when the user presses Enter. The user stops it with "n".
3. Read the terminal. Make sure that the script shows the command and waits.
4. Show the dialog. Run the command in the background:

   ```bash
   python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py terminal \
     --title "Push 2 commits to origin main" \
     --where 'Terminal tab "push"' \
     --step 'Read the command.' \
     --step 'Press Enter.'
   ```

5. Wait for the result of the submit, not only for the dialog. For example, run `git status -sb` until the branch is not ahead. Then continue.

Do not run `handoff.py submit` with your shell tool, and do not give it an answer through a pipe. The script refuses to run without a terminal: the user gives the answer.

Do not ask the user to stage files, to write a commit message, or to type the command. Do not stop with "not committed" or "say commit". The commit is your work. The submit is the one step of the user.

The script prints one JSON object when it ends: `done` (exit code 0) after the command ran, `not_done` (3) if the user stopped it, `error` (1) if the command failed or there is no terminal.

## Open a pull request

Push the branch first. Then run this command in the repository:

```bash
python3 SKILL_DIR/handoff.py pr --title "Add CSV export" --body-file pr-body.md
```

The script opens the GitHub form with the title and the description filled in. The user only clicks "Create pull request".

- The head is the current branch. The base is the default branch on GitHub. Use `--head` and `--base` to change them.
- The script refuses the branch if the remote does not have the local commit.
- The script gets OWNER/NAME from the URL of `origin`. Use `--remote` or `--repo OWNER/NAME` to change it.
- For a pull request from a fork to its upstream repository, push the branch to the fork. Then give `--repo UPSTREAM_OWNER/NAME`. The script names the branch as OWNER:BRANCH, with OWNER from the URL of the remote.
- Do not create a pull request with `gh pr create`, the GitHub API, or another tool.

## 4. Wait for the answer

The user can take many minutes. Run the command in the background (in Claude Code: `run_in_background: true`). Tell the user in one sentence that the dialog is open. The default time limit is 30 minutes. `--timeout MINUTES` changes it.

The script prints one JSON object:

| `status` | Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `done` | 0 | The user did the steps. |
| `not_done` | 3 | The user did not do the steps. `note` can give the reason. |
| `timeout` | 4 | The user did not answer in time. |
| `error` | 1 | The script did not show the dialog. `error` gives the reason. |

Exit code 2 means bad arguments. Then the script writes the usage to stderr.

After `pr`, a `done` answer also has `pr_url`. It is the open pull request that `gh` found for the branch, or `null` if `gh` is not available or found none.

## 5. After the answer

- `done`: Check the result with the API or CLI of the service when you can, for example `gh pr view`. Then continue.
- `not_done`: Read the note. Do not show the same steps again without a change. Ask the user what to do next.
- `timeout`: Ask the user before you try again.
- `error`: Fix the cause. If the host is not allowed, ask the user.

## More than one task

A request can have more than one task, for example a web deploy, a store release, and a payment setup. A task is blocked when it gets to a human step, or to an error that you cannot fix. A blocked task does not stop the other tasks.

1. Stop the blocked task, and each task that needs its result.
2. If the blocked step has a web page, give it to the user with `handoff.py`. Run the command in the background.
3. Continue the other tasks while the dialog is open. Each dialog runs in its own process, so more than one dialog can be open at the same time.
4. After a `done` answer, check the result. Then continue the blocked task.
5. Put each question for the user at the end, after the other tasks are done or blocked. A question ends your turn and stops the other tasks.

At the end, give the result of each task. For a blocked task, give the cause and the step that the user must do.

If the user tells you to stop, stop all the tasks.

## Safety

- Never ask the user to type or paste a password, key, token, or card number into the chat or the note. Tell the user where to put a secret, for example in the secret store of the host.
- Never click the final button yourself with a browser tool.
