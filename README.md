# deploy-handoff

A Claude Code plugin for the steps that an AI agent must not do alone.

An agent can build, test, and upload a release. Some steps must come from a person: publish the release, turn on live payments, accept an OAuth consent, or create a pull request. The agent drives the browser as far as it can. Then deploy-handoff shows a small dialog on top of the browser. The dialog tells you what to do, in short steps in [Simplified Technical English](https://asd-ste100.org). You do the final click. Then you click **Done** or **Not done**, and the agent continues.

deploy-handoff never makes the final click for you. It never asks for a password or a key.

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add equwal/deploy-handoff
/plugin install deploy-handoff@deploy-handoff
```

Then add the [rule](#rule). The rule tells Claude when to use the plugin.

Requirements:

- Python 3.11 or later, with Tk. The python.org installers for Windows and macOS include Tk. On Debian and Ubuntu, install `python3-tk`.
- `git` for the `pr` command. `gh` is optional. If `gh` is available, the `pr` command gives the URL of the new pull request.
- For the browser driver: Brave or Chrome, and Node.js with `npx`. The plugin starts [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) with `npx`.

## How it works

The plugin adds the skill `deploy-handoff` and the agent `browser-driver`. Claude uses the skill when a task reaches a human step, and when it opens a GitHub pull request. The skill drives your Brave profile, where you are signed in, and then runs `skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py`. The agent starts only if you ask for a fresh browser. Other tools can run the script in the same way.

Open a page and show the steps:

```bash
python3 skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py open \
  --url https://play.google.com/console \
  --title "Send version 1.4.0 for review" \
  --step 'Open "Publishing overview".' \
  --step 'Click "Send changes for review".'
```

If the agent already drove a browser to the page, it adds `--no-open`. Then the script shows only the dialog. The script refuses a title or a step with more than 20 words or with a semicolon.

Show the steps for a question that a program asks in a terminal. The command opens no page and needs no allowed host:

```bash
python3 skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py terminal \
  --title "Install Herdr on the build server" \
  --where 'Terminal tab "herdr: add build server"' \
  --step 'Press "Y".'
```

Claude starts the program in a terminal that you see and stops at the question. You give the answer.

Keep the submit of a change for yourself. A submit is a command that sends work out of your computer, for example `git push` or a production deploy. Claude makes the commit and starts the submit in a terminal that you see. The command runs when you press Enter:

```bash
python3 skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py submit --title "Push 2 commits to origin main" -- git push origin main
```

The script refuses to run without a terminal, so a program cannot give the answer for you. Claude runs a submit itself only after you give the word: DEPLOY, or a direct instruction such as "push it".

Open the pull request form for the current branch:

```bash
python3 skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py pr --title "Add CSV export" --body-file body.md
```

For a pull request from a fork to its upstream repository, push the branch to the fork and add `--repo UPSTREAM_OWNER/NAME`. The form then compares the branch of the fork with the upstream repository.

The script prints one JSON object, for example `{"status": "done", "note": ""}`. [SKILL.md](skills/deploy-handoff/SKILL.md) lists all statuses and exit codes.

## Rule

The skill tells Claude how to hand off a step. The rule [rules/deploy-handoff.md](rules/deploy-handoff.md) tells Claude when to do it. Without the rule, Claude can refuse a deploy task because one step is for a human. With the rule, Claude does all the other work and hands off only that step.

The rule also tells Claude to:

- Run a deploy command, for example `vercel deploy` or `gh release create`, when a command can do the step. The permission prompt of Claude Code is your approval. In a permission mode with no prompt, Claude asks you in the chat before a production deploy, a release, or a live payment change.
- Continue the other tasks of a request while one task waits for you in the dialog.
- Drive the browser to the page of the last step, not only to the home page of a console.
- Use the browser profile in which you are signed in. Claude starts a fresh profile only if you ask for it.
- Push directly when you ask for a change, and open a pull request only when the repository needs one. The pull request form opens with `handoff.py pr`.

To use the rule in all your projects, copy it to `~/.claude/rules/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
curl -fsSL -o ~/.claude/rules/deploy-handoff.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equwal/deploy-handoff/main/rules/deploy-handoff.md
```

To use it in one project only, copy it to `.claude/rules/` in that project. Claude Code reads the Markdown files in these folders at the start of each session. Edit the rule to fit your work. For example, remove the pull request section if your team reviews each change.

## Browser

The script opens pages in a new tab of your default browser. To use a different browser, set the `BROWSER` environment variable. The Python `webbrowser` module reads it.

To open pages in one Brave profile, add `brave_profile` to `~/.config/deploy-handoff/config.toml`. Write the name that Brave shows for the profile. The case does not matter.

```toml
brave_profile = "Work"
```

Then the script opens each page in that profile, also when Brave runs already, and ignores `BROWSER`. If Brave has no profile with this name, the script stops with an error. It does not open another profile. Install the Claude in Chrome extension in this profile. The skill uses it for the browser steps. The skill never starts a fresh profile unless you ask for it.

## Browser driver

The agent [browser-driver](agents/browser-driver.md) does the browser steps before the dialog in a fresh browser. It stops at the first human step. Then the dialog shows only that step. Claude does not start it unless you ask for a fresh browser.

The agent works in its own browser with a fresh profile, not in your browser. Start that browser with this command. Without `--fresh`, the command refuses to start:

```bash
python3 skills/deploy-handoff/handoff.py browser --fresh
```

The command starts Brave, or Chrome if Brave is not installed. `--exe PATH` names a different Chromium browser. The browser uses its own profile in `~/.config/deploy-handoff/browser` and opens the remote debugging port 9333 on 127.0.0.1. If the browser runs already, the command only prints its status. The agent cannot use your Brave profile, because Chromium 136 and later ignores the remote debugging port for the default profile folder.

[Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) controls this browser through the port. Thus the agent works when the window is behind other windows, and you can keep working. It also fills in file dialogs without the mouse. On Windows, the agent can use [Windows-MCP](https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP) for a window of the operating system, if you have it.

Sign in to each console one time in this browser. The profile keeps the sign-in. When the agent finds a sign-in page, it gives the sign-in to you as a human step.

The browser starts with no window. The agent opens a window when it opens a page. If you close the window, the browser does not stop, and the agent can open a new window.

Any program on your computer can control this browser through the port. Use the profile only for deploy consoles. When you do not need the browser, stop its process: the `brave.exe` or `chrome.exe` process with `--remote-debugging-port=9333` in its command line. On Windows, Task Manager shows the command line on the Details tab when you add the "Command line" column. On macOS and Linux, run `pkill -f -- --remote-debugging-port=9333`.

The agent gets only the tools that look at the page and act on it. It gets no tool that runs code in the page or reads the network traffic, and no shell, file, registry, or clipboard tool. It can upload only files in the project folder.

The agent never types a password, a code, a key, or a card number. It never signs in, solves a CAPTCHA, accepts terms, or makes the final click. If it cannot continue, it gives the status `not_done` and the error to the agent that started it.

## Allowed hosts

The script opens only `https` pages on allowed hosts. This stops an agent that follows bad instructions from sending you to a fake sign-in page. The dialog also shows the host of the page.

[config.toml](skills/deploy-handoff/config.toml) has the default list: GitHub, GitLab, Stripe, Google Play, F-Droid, App Store Connect, and some cloud and hosting consoles. An entry also allows its subdomains.

To add hosts, make the file `~/.config/deploy-handoff/config.toml`. If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, the file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/deploy-handoff/config.toml`.

```toml
allowed_hosts = ["dashboard.example.com"]
```

## Development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --group dev
.venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check
.venv/bin/python -m mypy skills/deploy-handoff
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s skills/deploy-handoff
```

On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\python`. `pip install --group` needs pip 25.1 or later. The dialog tests show small windows for a short time. One browser test starts Brave or Chrome with a temporary profile. If you have neither, unittest skips that test.
